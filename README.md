## Installation

2. Navigate to the project directory: `e:/GradGoods/ecommerce/Frontend/gradgoods`
3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

For development purposes, you can use a local server to avoid CORS issues with assets:

- If you have Python installed: `python -m http.server 8000`
- If you have Node.js: Install `http-server` globally and run `http-server`
- Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

- **Product Interaction**: Click on products to view details (links are placeholders for now).
